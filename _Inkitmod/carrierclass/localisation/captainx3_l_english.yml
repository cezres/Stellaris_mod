 captainx3.4.name:0 "Mining Base Bonus Received"
 captainx3.4.desc:0 "After months of dangerous work, we have finally built our first mining base! This base offers a 10% bonus to the production of minerals across our entire empire and increases our mineral storage capacity by 5000. Our experts say that we can build up to 5 of these bases for a cumulative bonus of 50% mineral production and 25000 mineral storage. However, they caution us that the bases are expensive to maintain and to make sure that we have the income to keep them running before investing the time and resources to build more."
 
 captainx3.5.name:0 "Mining Base Limit Reached"
 captainx3.5.desc:0 "We have build a total of 5 mining bases and reached our maximum potential production bonus. Building additional bases will not yield any significant increases to our production, but will cost more to maintain."
